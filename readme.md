- Objects are created from templates called classes.

#### Key concepts:

- **Object**: An instance of a class. It stores the data and methods.
- **Inheritance**: The ability for a class to inherit the attributes and behaviors of another class.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability for a class to take on multiple forms
